# The Use of FlappyBird for Reinforcement Learning 

# The Purpose of this Project is to increase My AI skills 


The First Part of the Development is to develop the Game 

Then I will use Reinforcement to Play the Game 


There is some Fix, that the Game don't keep Track of the High score 
There is no dificulty involve in the game 



# AI 


The AI will be develop so that it have no acess to the codebase 

Only the the output of the code of the game playing the code will be able to see 

Then the code will teach it self to play the Game

The techStack I will be using is the OpenCV to see the screen play and
Then giving the code access to the button and then Learn how to play
