# The Use of FlappyBird for Reinforcement Learning 

# The Purpose of this Project is to increase My AI skills 


The First Part of the Development is to develop the Game 

Then I will use Reinforcement to Play the Game 



# AI 


The aim of this is that I don't want to expose the code to AI,
I will use OpenCv and give it Accesss to the Game to Learn how to Play
